title: Using Github Pages
---

Github pages is a great service provided to developers for serving static content.

There are two ways of using this awesome feature:

1. Create a repo named `[yourUserName].github.io` and make sure it has an index file because the index
   file will be used as the entry point. Once you create the repo and add some HTML to it you should
   see your static website at `https://[yourUserName].github.io`.

2. Create a repo. This time the name doesn't matter. Create a brach called gh-pages and push the content you want to serve to this branch. After completing this step you should see your static website
   at `https://[yourUserName].github.io/[theNameOfYourRepo]`.

Thanks for reading :)
